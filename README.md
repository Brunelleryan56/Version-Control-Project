Clone Your Repository on Your Local Machine

B.  Clone your remote repository from GitLab to your local machine using the command line interface. Include a screenshot of the command line action and be sure to have your repository name visible in the command prompt.

 

Make Changes, Commit, and Push

C.  Modify (using any text editor) three HTML files on the Working branch by doing the following:

1.  Commit each change with a short, meaningful message that explains all changes you have made to the three HTML files. Include a screenshot for each git command for each change and be sure to have your repository name visible in the command prompt.

Simulate a Merge Conflict

E.  Introduce a merge conflict with the "Test" branch by doing the following:

3.  Create a "summary.txt" file in the retrospective directory and include the following:
